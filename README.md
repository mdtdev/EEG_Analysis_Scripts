# EEG_Analysis_Scripts

Analysis scripts for EEG experiments at GSU. This repositiory will hold the materials developed for specific experiments, while the EEG Blocks repo will hold the new EEG toolkit we are developing. The older EEG and EEG_Pipeline repos are depriciated and should not be used for new code or new projects.
